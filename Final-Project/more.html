            <h1> What Is  N2? </h1>
           <p>
            This is the next step in the sleep cycle.
            It  makes up about 40% of your sleep cycle and it is still light sleep.
            N2 is deeper than N1 but now your body will completly relax and your brain will start to slow down.
            The bodies tempture will drop slightly as your body settles.
            There will be slight movement (like teeth grinding and jerking) which is all totally normal and known as "sleep spindles".

            <h2>Sleep Spindles</h2>
           <p>
            The National Library of Medicine defines it as,"burstlike signals in the electroencephalogram (EEG) of the sleeping mammalian brain and electrical surface correlates of neuronal oscillations in thalamus."
            In other words, it is your brain sending short signals throughout your body. 
            These signals have been recorded using an electroencephalogram or EEG.
            This is a machine that records you brain activity while you sleep.
            With this machine we see that when peole reach the N2 sleep this brain activity can be easily recognized and recorded.
            Sleep spindles are very important for memory consolidation.

            <h2> Memory Consolidation</h2>
            <p>
                Memory consolidation,"refers to a process by which labile newly formed memory traces are progressively strengthened into long term memories and become more resistant to interference" (by Science Direct.)
                When you sleep it takes all the short term memeries and turn them into long term and this could take minutes,days,or weeks.
                It is like if you studied the night befor an exam and when you woke up you were able to focus and rember more from your notes.
