              <p>
                Your body throught the course of a night goes through 4 sleep stages.
                These 4 stages are: N1,N2 or light sleep,N3 or deep sleep,and REM or Dream state.
                Basiclly sleep is split into 2 cycles,REM and NREM, where NREM is split into 3 stages:N1,2,and 3.
                Your body goes through this cycle around 4 times before you wake up.
                When you go through all these stages it helps your body decompress and relax.
                It isn't entierly about the amount of sleep,that's why we take catnaps, but it's the quality of said sleep that matters.
                When your body goes through all its stages your body will function better and it can increase your brain function.
                So the first step of any sleep rotuine is to get comfy.

                <h3> 3 Easy Fixes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> One of the easiest fixest is to just change your mattress.
                        Giving you relief on your spine and shoulders providing you a better sleep.
                    </li>
                    <li> Another way is stopping your caffeine intake at least 1-2 hours before bed.
                        This is because your body can quickly absorb caffeine but the affects of it can last for hours after ingestion.
                    </li>
                    <li> Tempture also affects your sleep.
                        being too clod or hot makes it harder for you to get comfotable or stay asleep.
                    </li>
