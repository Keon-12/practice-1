        <h2> Acient Oasis </h2>
        <p> Since we know that dino span over 3 different Time periods: The triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous, lets talk about how wounderfull these places were. At the time in which in which dinos lived it would have been an absolute paradise... for them.</p>
      
        <h3> The Triassic </h3>
       <p> The triassic started around 250 million years ago and lasted until 200 million years ago. During this time period all the continents were pushed together into somthing know know as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Pangea" target="_blank">pangea</a>. Now think of a nice beach day, the warm sand, the cold water , and the nice crisp breeze and for the most part that is what the dinosaurs in the triassic lived through excpt the air would have been very dry and the CO2 would have been super high. The sea levels would have been around 10 meters higher than today. I know after hering this it might make you a little scared to go back and see our giant friends, but I did ask you what type of dinosaurs you were and if you answered you will be fine. The dry humid air would feel like a paradise for the animals that lived there. This is because of the triassic being a sort of rebirth for the earth after the <a href="https://sustainability.stanford.edu/news/what-caused-earths-biggest-mass-extinction" target="_blank"> "Great Dying"</a>. don't worry i'll give you a breif run-down. The great dying happened over 200 MILLION years ago and scienctis are quite sure what happened but it is theorised that in the atlantic see experienced lots of valcanic activity which raised the CO2 levels. This caused the animals, mostly marine life, to die... over 90% died during this event.  The sea became a place that no one wanted to live in and on land mainly bugs and an early ansestor of dinosaurs:Sauropsids. I know another big paragraph but that MIGHT be the last one, I just wanted to explain why it was so hot during the triassic and what caused it.  Just imagine we died suddenly you would want people to talk about you too(or maybe you don't idk).
    Now millions of years later the world started to get better and life started to rebirth and so on. If you lived inland you had to live through dry air and if you were on the coast you had to dodge monsoons. During the middle triassic the supercontinent pangea was starting to split.</p>
    <p> So maybe this isn't the best time period to live in but we still have 2 more!</p>

    <h4> Fun Fact: when pangea split it made the continent </h4>
        <ul>
            <li> Africa </li>
            <li> South America </li>
            <li> Australia </li>
            <li> Aniarctica </li>
        </ul> 
    <H4> This is also the reason why we find the same rock and fossils on the east coast of the U.S and on the west coast of Africa.</H4>
    
   
    <h3> The Jurassic </h3>  
<p> This period started around 200 million years ago and ended about 150 millionyears ago. during this time pangea was still splitting but it would have lookedd like a big swamp. with lots of plants and 2 new continents called Laurasia and Gondwana. At the end of the Triassic period there was another mass extinction called the Triassic-Jurassic extinction this was cosidered the "age of dinosaurs", since many land animals like the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/animal/phytosaur" target="_blank">phytosaurs</a> died and left early dinos alive and thriving. This was aidded by the fact that pangea was splitting up which caused some groups to expand and florish. This is a time in which having a long neck was definitely in style!</p>
<h4 style="border-radius: 50;"> Fun Fact: Australia was one of the first to split from pangea and took marsupials with it. They essentially evolved in a vacuum with little to no compition from other species. </h4>

<h3> The Cretaceous </h3>  
<p> The Cretaceous period started around 145 milliom years ago and lasted until 66 million years ago. This is when we start to see the big name like the t-rex and rapters and this is the last period before the <a href="https://naturalhistory.si.edu/research/paleobiology/news-and-highlights/cbep-2026" target="_blank">Paleogene</a>(this is the start of the cenozoic era or the start of our early ancestors and this is the current era). During the cretaceous the climate was still hot and humid and the water was over 170 meters higher today, but life was still lush and rainforrest started to grow near the poles. This is the time in which our world stated to become more recognizable. At the end of the cretaceous some of you might already know but te dinosaurs went extinct. It is theorised to have been caused by an asteroid stricking the earth which caused massive volcanic eruption that shifted the climate again causing the Ice age. Mainly mammals survied this event leving them so expand rapidly ultimately this killed the dinosaurs and brought their regin to an end.</p>

<h3> A finale Rest </h3>
<p> Well traveler our jurney has come to an end, and while I wish I could tell you more this would be HUNDREDS of pages long. I hope you enjoied this trip down the history of such big creatures. Until Next Time!</p>
