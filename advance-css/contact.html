              <h2> Look at the Bones</h2>
        <p> The first dinosaur bones were found in 1677 by a man named <a href="https://emlo-portal.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/collections/?catalogue=robert-plot" target="_blank"> Robert Plot</a>. He didn't know it was a dinoosaur when he found it. Plot assumed that it was some type of elephant bone but after comparing it with other types of elephants he concluded that it came from some giant species. In the early 1800's <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Buckland" target="_blank">William Buckland</a> found the jaw of a megalosaurus(he didn't know at the time) after numerous testing he figured out that it came from a acient type of lizzard and gave it the name "megalosaurus". 1 year after Buckland wrote his article on the megalosaurus <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gideon-Algernon-Mantell" target="_blank">Gideon Mantell</a> ,a palaeontologist, used it as the bases for the dinosaur he discoverd called the "Iguanodon". It was named after the teeth he found, since it resembled the teeth of iguanas. Montell use this to find yet another speciesof dinosaur that he named the "Hylaeosaurus". These were the first 3 dinosaurs to be discorverd and named.</p>

           <h3> Progressing Time</h3>
          <p>The Discovery of dinosaurs help early scientist understand just how long organisms have been on the planet and push back the date of our planets formation. This also gave the scientist an early idea of evolution. It helped them understand the enviorment that earth's acient life went through and the diet they ate. This also futhered our knowledge of biology and animal behivor and devolopment. From just their bones we can tell how they ate,sleeped,walked,and even breathe. It made the theroy of humans being the first "living thing" to us being one of the most recent.</p>
