  <p> This bird like creature would have feed on mostly small lizzards,birds,and fish. There is also evidence of this small bird eating other mammals.
    They lived in modern day hina and would have been able to glide like a flying squirel.
    The microraptor had wings on all 4 limbs. It was also the first to be found with asymmetrical feathers.Scientist believe that this was a way for the dino to regulate his tempture.
